# Automation_of_Due-Diligence_Project

### üåê Due-Diligent Project Automation
Python is the backbone of this geospatial automation, streamlining the entire due diligence process. Leveraging robust libraries for geospatial data gathering prowess of geemap, gdal, and geopandas to the elegant mapping according to cartographic principle by PyQGIS within QGIS project, and finally summarizes all important information in a ppt-based report. Every stage of the due diligence process has been meticulously automated.

### üó∫Ô∏è Highlights:
Data Gathering & Extraction: Harnessing geemap, gdal, and geopandas to efficiently collect and distill geospatial insights.
Mapping: PyQGIS takes center stage, utilizing the advantages from QGIS software, well-known as robust open source GIS Software to visualize data in a map with finesse.
Dynamic Reporting: Crafted using python-pptx, the reporting phase transforms raw data into comprehensive presentations, weaving together maps, charts, and key insights.
